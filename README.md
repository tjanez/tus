Tadej's Useful Scripts (TUS)
============================

A collection of scripts that I deem useful to remember and share.

To use the scripts, install the Python package with `pip3`:

```
pip3 install <path-to-tus-directory>
```

To develop the scripts, install the Python package in your user's site-packages
directory in editable mode:

```
pip3 install --user --editable <path-to-tus-directory>
```
